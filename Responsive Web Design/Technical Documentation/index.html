               The world I live in is called <code>Earth</code>. It's scenery is filled with green grass, water that is like the color of the sky and many varieties of people. While I was gazing underneath, I can see all of it. The children playing, the high buildings, and many things that doesn't exists on my planet.
            </p>
            <p>
               I placed my spaceship on the ground activated it's invisibility. I walked from many big things called tree and they are much larger than the one from my planet. I continue to walk and I'm seeing many creatures and scanned them all. Raccoons, ants, birds, and many more. Half of them hostile that I need to fend. Overall this world is great for habitation. Wildlife and environment is very suitable to live in. Well except for very bad air contamination. I will be checking where this came from.

            I talked to one of them and believe it or not, they are hilarious to talk with. They always say words that I am not yet familiar with. I can tell you, they say something like "lol", "sup", and "@$+#"! Such fun words! However the last one, I don't think it is.
         </p>
         <p>
            I talked to all types of them. A girl wearing a strange clothing that she said a uniform to go to school, a man wearing a suit that looks good but uncomfortable. I tried asking him but he aaid he is late for work. I guess humans have work too huh? Should I apologize to him? Maybe later.
         </p>
         <p>    
            I talked to a human that will die soon, an elderly if I say on human terms. I told her that humans are dumb creatures yet fun to be with. She laughs and said, "Yes humans are really dumb creatures, we made a lot of mistakes in our life. We get sick, get old, get hurt. Yet I am proud to be here. Why? Because these dumb creatures called humans are what we made off. They are the ones who will make you happy when you're sad. Though they are also the one who will make you sad when you're happy. That, itself is what I call joy."
         </p>
         <p>
            I guess elderly humans have a lot of knowledge. I may have knew about humans a bit more than before. I continued wandering <code>Earth</code> with more understanding about it.

         <p>I also tried food here and it is bizzare yet an outstanding experience. They eat that came from dirt? I'm a bit doubtful if it is delicous or if it's poisoned but when I tried it tastes so good. They called this one french fries is it? I may go back here for more. Hmm.
         <br><br>
            List of food to try next:
         <ul>
            <li>Hamburger</li>
            <li>Fried Chicken</li>
            <li>Banana</li>

            Humans are interesting creatures. They have a lot of knowledge about things. That granny especially. Maybe it's because she lives longer than anyone. I sit on a chair. Around me is many unknown things. Children uses this things to have fun. Slides, seesaw, and climbers the machine shows. I think it is fun to use those.
         </p>
         <p>
            Let's go! First is the slide. I climbed at it and then... Wow! That was exhilarating! I did it again. And again. And again. "Hey! Can you take me up there?" While I was climbing I heard that voice that came from underneath. <i>"Hurry! I wanna try the slide please!"</i> the little girl continued to say. She looks so small that I'm reluctant to take her up here. But I don't wanna disappoint the sparkle in her eyes. <i>"Alright then."</i> I said as I used my power to levitate her up to the slide. <i>"Wow! I'm floating! Are you sing magic?"</i> <i>"Yes... Wait. Humans do not use magic?"</i> <i>"Of course not! How could we?"</i> <i>"Oh no! Please keep my magic usage hidden okay?"</i> <i>"Of course! I won't say it anyone! Even if I got hit by a thunder."</i> Thunder? I guess she will really keep it a secret. <i>"That's great to hear. How about we go to slide now?"</i> <i>"Yes!"</i>

         <i>"Ahahahahahaha!" That was fun!"</i> We played for like 5 hours . More children join and we played. I didn't feel this way before. Maybe because the other planet I visited and my own planet have no creatures. I remembered my own planet. I am alone. I created the spaceship so I can find someone so I can ease my loneliness. And when I found <code>Earth</code>. I am elated beyond everything. <i>"Hey! You still here?"</i> The girl said. Oh I am daydreaming huh? <i>"Yes. Yes. I am here." "Now that I think about it, you haven't told me your name yet. What is it?"</i> Name? <i>"You first, what is your name?" </i><i>"Me? I am Hana. Now yours!"</i> <i>Hana huh? "I am... <code> Erit.</code>"</i>
